### Research Objective
By analyzing economic data for the CA Employment Development Department and State of California COVID-19 Health Data (March 2020 - July 2020), we will seek to understand what effect (if any), county labor force distribution may have on COVID-19 case rates. More specifically we will seek to understand the effect that agricultural employment may have on COVID-19 case rates.
